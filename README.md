# Machine Learning Implementations

This repository serves as a reference for Joy to revisit when he needs a refresher on implementing machine learning models.

## Overview

The repository contains several machine learning implementations developed by Joy. Each file is titled with the specific model used and covers various use cases and domains. While most of the implementations are focused on computational biology or bioinformatics, the underlying models can be applied to any domain.

Please note that these files are not standalone and may require additional associated files and data. For the sake of simplicity and to discourage reckless code copying, these dependencies have been intentionally omitted. Some of the files were developed for specific projects, and to maintain the integrity of those projects, this repository is intentionally kept vague to make it less discoverable through simple internet searches.

## Disclaimer

The primary purpose of this repository is for Joy's personal benefit and as a personal reference. The code and implementations provided are not intended for direct use without proper understanding, context, and necessary adaptations. They are shared as examples and learning resources rather than ready-to-use solutions.

Please exercise caution and discretion when using any code from this repository, and ensure you have a thorough understanding of its implications and potential limitations before applying it to your own projects.
